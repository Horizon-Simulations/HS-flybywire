; 22 April 2021 Ver 3 of idle thrust adjustments. This matches IRL decel CONF 3 from 160 to 140 KCAS, -3 deg FPA, GD of 23 seconds
; Also seems to provide more realistic decel for other configurations (even though CONF 3 IRL would be with approach
; idle, which isn't yet modeled). Will need to be re-looked at if/when flight and approach idle N1 are modeled
; 29 April 2021. Changed spool and CN1 vs CN2 tables for belowe Idle conditions (start-up)
; TazX - 29 April 2021. Changed spool and CN1 vs CN2 tables for belowe Idle conditions (start-up)
; Minor tweaks to 2 values of N1-thrust at idle N1 (along with flight model changes) to better match FCOM data
